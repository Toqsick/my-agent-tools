# Web Content Reconnaissance

When a user asks you to find hidden content across their (or a target's)
websites — key fragments, passwords, Easter eggs, encrypted messages
spread across pages — follow this systematic approach.

## Phase 1: Surface enumeration

**Before diving deep, map the attack surface.**

1. **Subdomain scanning.** Check all subdomains listed on the /projects
   page (or the sitemap). Batch-check with:
   ```bash
   for sub in a b c; do
     code=$(curl -sL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://$sub.example.com" 2>/dev/null)
     echo "$sub → $code"
   done
   ```

2. **Sitemap & robots.txt.** Fetch both — they often list hidden paths:
   - `https://example.com/robots.txt`
   - `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`

3. **Git commit history.** When the site is hosted on GitHub Pages, check
   the repo's commit log for giveaway-related messages:
   ```bash
   curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/User/Repo/commits?per_page=30"
   ```
   Look for messages like "add hint", "fix styling", "ignore giveaway",
   "add minecraft giveaway". These commits often ADD the hidden fragments.
   Check the file patch in each:
   ```bash
   curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/User/Repo/commits/<sha>"
   ```

4. **CDN file listing.** If the site uses a static file CDN (e.g.
   `cdn.example.com/f/static/`), probe for giveaway-related filenames:
   ```
   giveaway.txt, key.txt, fragment.txt, part2.txt, hint.txt
   ```

## Phase 2: Client-side JavaScript analysis

**Hidden content is often behind click handlers, not in the HTML.**

1. **Extract ALL inline event handlers.** The main page might have only 2
   `onclick` handlers, but other pages (about, resume, projects, contact)
   may have more:
   ```python
   import re
   handlers = re.findall(r'onclick="([^"]*)"', html)
   alerts = re.findall(r'alert\(["\']([^"\']+)["\']\)', html)
   ```

2. **Check external JS files.** Some fragments are loaded from separate
   JS files that aren't obvious from the HTML. Watch for:
   ```html
   <script src="https://api.example.com/script.js"></script>
   ```
   These can contain `eval(atob('...'))` with hidden alerts.

3. **Check form submit/button click handlers.** Hunt pages often hide
   fragments behind button clicks (Encrypt/Decrypt buttons, Generate QR,
   Submit forms). Read the entire JS file — not all "encoding" is real:
   sometimes clicking "Encrypt" with a specific input triggers a
   **hardcoded `alert()`**, not actual encoding output:
   ```javascript
   // The encoder may just alert a hardcoded fragment value, not a real transform
   if(t == "93b51f86" && s == false){
     s=true; alert("6."); alert("8252d8c3"); alert("next: ...");
   }
   ```
   Same pattern on QR generators when you enter a specific URL. Always
   scan for string comparisons on input values that gate `alert()` calls.

4. **Base64 decode all suspicious strings.** Patterns like
   `eval(atob('...'))` or base64 in `onclick` attributes:
   ```python
   import base64
   decoded = base64.b64decode(string).decode()
   ```

5. **Look for fragment numbering patterns.** Fragments are often revealed
   as `alert("N.")` followed by `alert("VALUE")` followed by
   `alert("next: HINT")`. The "N." tells you which fragment number this is.

6. **Check for truncated clues.** Clues often cut off the last word with
   dashes. The dashes equal the remaining letters:
   - "its some static file on some cd-" → "cdn" (3 dashes = 3 chars)
   - "maybe this part of the key is the pas----" → "pass" (4 dashes = 4 chars)

## Phase 3: Follow the chain

**Each fragment (except the last) leads to the next one.**

1. **Read the "next:" message carefully.** It tells you WHERE to find
   the next fragment and HOW to access it:
   - "next: back to / again" → go to the main page
   - "next: its some static file on some cd-" → check the CDN
   - "next: maybe when you enter this part of the key into some special
     trinary encoder" → enter the fragment value into the 312 encoder

2. **Each fragment is typically 8 hex characters.** But fragment 8 is
   often an encrypted payload (Base64, to be decrypted with fragments 1-7
   as the key).

3. **If a clue mentions "password" or "pass", the fragment IS the
   password** to access something (a private blog, an encrypted file).

4. **Blogs may have hidden/private posts.** Check the blog's API:
   ```
   /api/list/blog/         → lists all posts including private ones
   /api/list/blog/private  → lists private posts
   ```
   Private posts may be AES-encrypted (see Phase 4).

## Phase 4: Reverse-engineering client-side crypto

**When you find encrypted content in a client-side app, extract the
decryption parameters.**

1. **Find the relevant JS chunk.** In Next.js apps, check the page HTML
   for the chunk IDs, then fetch the JS chunk files.

2. **Search for crypto keywords** in the minified JS:
   ```
   decrypt, AES, GCM, PBKDF2, salt, iterations, deriveKey
   ```

3. **Extract decryption parameters.** Look for:
   - Algorithm: `AES-GCM`, `AES-CBC`, etc.
   - PBKDF2 parameters: salt string, iteration count, hash algorithm
   - IV/Nonce: usually the first N bytes of the encrypted data
   - Tag: in GCM mode, usually the last 16 bytes of ciphertext

4. **Replicate in Python** using `cryptography` or `pycryptodome`:
   ```python
   from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
   import hashlib, base64

   # PBKDF2 key derivation
   key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(
       'sha256', password.encode(), salt_bytes,
       iterations, dklen=32
   )

   # AES-GCM decryption
   iv = enc_data[:12]
   ct_tag = enc_data[12:]
   ct = ct_tag[:-16]
   tag = ct_tag[-16:]
   cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.GCM(iv, tag))
   decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
   result = decryptor.update(ct) + decryptor.finalize()
   ```

5. **Pitfall:** The total encrypted data length determines possible
   AES-GCM/CBC layouts for a 32-byte payload:
   - **12-byte IV + 4-byte CT + 16-byte tag** → AES-GCM (4 plaintext
     bytes = 8 hex chars output). Most likely for fragment 8.
   - **16-byte IV + 16-byte CT** → AES-CBC with PKCS7 padding
   - **No-IV / full ciphertext** → AES-ECB

   Try all combinations. The last 8 hex digits of the raw decoded bytes
   may be the final fragment if AES decryption fails.

## Presentation format for findings

When reporting fragment/key discoveries, follow this structure — this user
wants raw data with traceability, not narrative:

```
#   value  — exact URL:line (how to trigger)
```

One line per fragment. Include the trigger/action needed. No prose
explaining the process unless asked. If a fragment has sub-steps (e.g.
decrypt with a password), note the command/formula compactly.

## Phase 5: Assembling the final key

**Fragments 1-7 form the KEY; fragment 8 is the encrypted payload.**

1. Concatenate fragments 1-7 as-is (they're already 8 hex chars each).
   Total: 56 hex characters.

2. Fragment 8 is encrypted with this key. Use the devglan.com online
   tool or replicate the decryption algorithm in Python.

3. The decrypted fragment 8 gives the final 8 hex characters.
   Total 64-digit key = 56 + 8 hex chars.

## Pitfalls

1. **Don't stop after finding one fragment.** The hint says "first and
   last part of the key are on this main website" AND "each key except
   the last gives a lead to the next key." Keep following the chain.

2. **Don't assume all fragments are found the same way.** Each may
   require a different trigger: clicking an element, reaching a certain
   page state (999 login attempts), entering a password, posting a
   comment, generating a QR code, etc.

3. **Check EVERY page on the main site**, not just the root path.
   /resume, /about, /projects, /contact, /blog can all have hidden
   onclick handlers that reveal fragments.

4. **YouTube video titles and descriptions and Twitter descriptions** can
   contain encoded clues. The **312 cipher** (triples of digits 1/2/3
   mapping to A-Z, with 0 = space) is used by some puzzle creators.
   Decryption rules:
   - Replace `4`→`11`, `5`→`22`, `6`→`33` before tokenization (compression)
   - Split into 3-digit tokens, look up in the cipher map
     (A=111, B=112, ..., Z=332; digits use 4-digit codes)
   - Decode with: `SIMPLE JAVASCRIPT DECRYPTER`

5. **Don't give up early.** User will say "Keep digging harder" — persist
   and go deeper. If the obvious approaches yield nothing, check git
   commit history, comment APIs, JSON endpoints, CDN file listings, and
   JavaScript chunks.

6. **The devglan.com text decryption API is rate-limited.** With a fresh
   session (requests.Session + JSESSIONID cookie + X-DG-TOKEN from the
   page's `<meta name="dg-token">`) the decrypt endpoint at
   `/online-tools/text-decryption` returns 200 with real error messages
   (`"decryptedText": "Error while decrypting the text"` = bad key,
   not auth failure). But sustained requests trigger 403 rate-limiting
   after 1-2 calls per token. The encrypt endpoint is even stricter
   (requires a Bearer token from `localStorage.devglan-data`).

   **Devglan algorithm (reverse-engineered):** AES-**CBC** + PKCS7 padding.
   - Deterministic (fixed IV derived server-side): same plaintext + same key
     = same ciphertext every time
   - Encrypted output is pure ciphertext (no IV/salt prepended), 16B aligned
   - **Proven CBC, not ECB** — encrypting 32 identical characters produces
     different ciphertext blocks for the identical 16-byte plaintext blocks:
     ```
     encrypt("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", key123)  → 48B output
     Block1: f0eea9e64f1e03e1dc979b6631ea131e
     Block2: 1da168aeff5c4a2834bc06fe412ed219  (≠ Block1 — would match in ECB)
     ```
   - 16-char and 32-char identical-text passwords produce the **same**
     ciphertext → confirms key input is truncated to a fixed size (≤16 bytes),
     which rules out hash-based derivation (SHA/MD5 of different-length
     inputs would differ)
   - Encrypted output length follows PKCS7: 1-16B plaintext → 16B out,
     17-32B plaintext → 32B out
   - **Key derivation remains opaque** — brute-forced 50+ combos (SHA256, MD5,
     SHA1, PBKDF2 with varied salts/iterations, UTF-16LE, repeated-to-size,
     zero-padded, HMAC) all failed to match. Java server-side transforms the
     password before passing to SecretKeySpec — the exact transform is unknown.

   **Recommendation:** Use Playwright via Node.js (fresh page load = fresh
   token, bypassing rate limits). A reusable script is at
   `scripts/playwright-devglan.js` in this skill:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp && npm install playwright && cp /root/.hermes/skills/web/web-content-reconnaissance/scripts/playwright-devglan.js . && node playwright-devglan.js
   ```

   **Testing approach when key derivation is unknown:** encrypt known
   plaintexts with the same key to observe output patterns. Two key
   diagnostics:

   ```javascript
   // 1) Key truncation test — same ciphertext confirms truncation, rules out hashing
   const ct1 = await enc('hello', 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa');         // 16 chars
   const ct2 = await enc('hello', 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'); // 32 chars
   // ct1 === ct2 → key input truncated (not hashed)

   // 2) CBC vs ECB test — diff blocks for identical plaintext blocks = CBC
   const ct3 = await enc('AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA', 'key123'); // 32 chars = 2 PKCS7 blocks
   // Block1 === Block2 → ECB; Block1 !== Block2 → CBC
   ```
